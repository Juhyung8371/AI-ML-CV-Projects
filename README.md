[Gaze-Controlled Mouse](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-ML-CV-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Gaze%20Mouse) aims to enhance human-computer interaction by implementing a real-time and affordable gaze-based mouse control. It can reduce the interaction time for users with limited hand mobility, leading to greater productivity and independence.

## *Machine Learning*

[Smart Snake](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-ML-CV-Projects/tree/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/Reinforcement%20Learning/Smart%20Snake%20PPO) is a self-learning AI for the Snake game using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm. From this project, I acquired a solid understanding of the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, laying a robust groundwork for future projects in this domain. It encompassed aspects such as model selection, reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, and custom environment creation.

## *Artificial Intelligence*

[Smart FlappyBird](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-ML-CV-Projects/tree/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/Genetic%20Algorithm/Smart%20Flappybird) project aims to make an AI that learns how to play Flappy Bird using a genetic algorithm. It involves common machine learning concepts like model design, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning, and genetic algorithm specific techniques like fitness function engineering, elitism, and genetic diversity management.
