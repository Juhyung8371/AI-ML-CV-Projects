[Gaze-Controlled Mouse](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Gaze%20Mouse) aims to enhance human-computer interaction by implementing a real-time and affordable gaze-based mouse control. It can reduce the interaction time for users with limited hand mobility, leading to greater productivity and independence.

## *Machine Learning*

[Smart Snake](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-Projects/tree/main/Reinforcement%20Learning/Smart%20Snake%20PPO) is a self-learning AI for the Snake game using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm. From this project, I acquired a solid understanding of the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, laying a robust groundwork for future projects in this domain. It encompassed critical research in model selection, reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, custom environment development, and parallel computing. The implemented solution outperformed existing alternatives by 18.7% and trivial solutions by 374.8%.

## *Artificial Intelligence*

[Smart FlappyBird](https://github.com/Juhyung8371/AI-Projects/tree/main/Genetic%20Algorithm/Smart%20Flappybird) project aims to make an AI that learns how to play Flappy Bird using a genetic algorithm. It involves common machine learning concepts like model design, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning, and genetic algorithm-specific techniques like fitness function engineering, elitism, and genetic diversity management.
