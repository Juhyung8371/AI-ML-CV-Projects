# Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)- Word Embeddings

We can represent the words as numerical vectors for computers to interpret human words. Word embeddings is one of the ways.

The CBOW technique captures the context of the word to better understand the relationship between words (syntatic and semantic structures).

Word vectors can be a building block of many Natural Language Processing tasks.
