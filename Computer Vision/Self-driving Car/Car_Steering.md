Take an image of the road and determine the correct steering angle.

Learning point:
I can reduce the training time by further preprocessing the image, like segmenting the road part from the sky since the road is the only important part.

Future work:
1. Test if turning the input image from color to grayscale affects the performance and training time.
2. Import this model to visual simulations like Carla to see if it works in the wild.
