# AI learns to play Snake by itself

# Summary

Created a self-learning AI for Snake using deep reinforcement learning, particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This project served as a valuable learning experience, involving critical research in model selection, reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, and developing a reusable environment with parallel computing capabilities.

# Objective

This project aims to explore deep-reinforcement learning and apply the knowledge to create my own self-learning AI agent. I chose the [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game because it is "Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master" (a.k.a [Bushnell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law)). I was curious if it's true for AIs as well. 

# Methodology
